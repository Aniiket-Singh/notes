what do u mean that ws connections are stateful and operate in memory? also, what is the difference between metadata(socketID, sessionID, userID) and socket data?

Let me clarify both points for you:

### 1. **WebSocket Connections Are Stateful and Operate in Memory**:

When I say that WebSocket connections are **stateful** and operate **in memory**, I mean that the WebSocket protocol maintains an open, persistent connection between the client and the server for the duration of their communication. This connection stays open as long as the client and server are connected. Here are some key aspects:

- **Stateful**: A WebSocket connection keeps track of the state of the communication (whether the connection is open, closed, etc.). This means the server knows that a specific client is connected, and that the client can send and receive messages over this connection. The connection is tied to that specific session between the client and server.
    
- **In Memory**: Once the WebSocket connection is established, the connection itself resides in **memory** on the server. The WebSocket protocol doesn’t persist the connection to disk. If the connection is lost (e.g., the client disconnects or the server restarts), the connection is gone, and you need to re-establish it.
    
    - When you send data via WebSockets, you don’t need to worry about saving or retrieving the connection itself from a database because it's already maintained in memory.
    - You cannot "store" an active WebSocket connection in a database because databases are not designed to handle the memory state of a live connection. Once closed, the connection no longer exists.

In essence, WebSockets are **volatile in nature**, meaning that if the connection is lost, you can’t simply look up and reconnect to it from a database—you have to re-establish it.

### 2. **Metadata vs. Socket Data**:

In the context of WebSockets, there are two main types of information you might be working with: **metadata** and **socket data**.

- **Metadata** (like `socketID`, `sessionID`, `userID`):
    
    - **Metadata** is information about the WebSocket connection, but not the connection itself. It is typically stored in a database or server memory to identify or track a user or session.
    - Examples of metadata:
        - **`socketID`**: A unique identifier assigned to each WebSocket connection. It's how the server tracks which connection belongs to which client.
        - **`sessionID`**: A unique identifier for the user's session. This could be used to track a user’s interactions or authenticate their identity.
        - **`userID`**: A unique identifier for a user. This links the WebSocket connection to a particular user in your application.
    - **Purpose of Metadata**: The metadata helps you locate or target specific connections or users but doesn’t contain the actual data that was sent over the WebSocket. It's a way to identify which WebSocket you want to send data to, but not the data itself.
- **Socket Data**:
    
    - **Socket Data** refers to the actual information transmitted through the WebSocket connection, such as the messages sent from the client to the server and vice versa.
    - For example, when a client sends a message via WebSocket, the message is **socket data**. Similarly, when the server sends a response, that’s also **socket data**.
    - This data is **not stored** in the connection itself (i.e., it's not part of the WebSocket state) but is the payload exchanged between the client and server. The data is typically transient—once it's received or sent, it's gone unless saved somewhere else (in a database or another system).
